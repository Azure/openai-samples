    "# Question Answering with Embeddings in Azure Cache for Redis (Enterprise)\n",
    "*This notebook has been edited from its [original form](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb) to store and retrieve embeddings with [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cache/).*\n",

    "Many use cases require [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) to respond to user questions with insightful answers. For example, a customer support chatbot may need to provide answers to common questions. The GPT models have picked up a lot of general knowledge in training, but we often need to ingest and use a large library of more specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "- Demonstrate a method for enabling GPT-3 to answer questions using a library of text as a reference\n",
    "- Use document embeddings for KNN search and retrieval in Redis\n",
    "- Use a dataset of Wikipedia articles about the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.\n",
