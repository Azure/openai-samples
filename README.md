# What is the Azure OpenAI service?

Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3, Codex and Embeddings model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

# Important concepts and terminology

# Responsible AI with Azure OpenAI
At Microsoft, we're committed to the advancement of AI driven by principles that put people first. Generative models such as the ones available in Azure OpenAI have significant potential benefits, but without careful design and thoughtful mitigations, such models have the potential to generate incorrect or even harmful content. Microsoft has made significant investments to help guard against abuse and unintended harm, which includes requiring applicants to show well-defined use cases, incorporating Microsoftâ€™s [principles for responsible AI use](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?activetab=pivot1:primaryr6), building content filters to support customers, and providing responsible AI implementation guidance to onboarded customers.

# OpenAI Samples

This repository contains samples demonstrating how to use GPT and ChatGPT via Python SDK or REST API.

## Installation
Install all Python modules and packages listed in the requirements.txt file using the below command.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Microsoft Azure Endpoints
In order to use the Open AI library or REST API with Microsoft Azure endpoints, you need to set OPENAI_API_KEY, RESOURCE_NAME & DEPLOYMENT_NAME in _config.json_ file.

```js
{
    "DEPLOYMENT_NAME":"<GPT model name>",
    "RESOURCE_NAME":"<your azure resource name>",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY":"<your_api_key>"
}
``` 

Learn more about Azure OpenAI Service REST API [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference).

## Example code
Sample codes for various use case scenario using GPT/ChatGPT can be found in respective 'Python SDK' & 'RestAPI' folders. 


## Requirements
Python 3.7.1+
