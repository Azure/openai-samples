    "# Building an auto insurance chatbot using Azure OpenAI ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem description\n",
    "    Build an Auto insurance chatbot to help users by answering their questions about auto insurance plans and providing personalized recommendations based on the user account information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Within the chatbot workflow, this model is placed after the topic classifier (which distinguishes the topic of a user input), and is only responsible for handling user utterances that are relevant to auto insurance questions.\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "    The chatbot is for an insurance company called Contoso, Ltd.\n",
    "    The chatbot has access to relevant FAQ knowledge base on auto insurance, as well as customers information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An example on customer information shown below:\n",
    "        Insurer's Name: Dave Huang\n",
    "        Membership Start Date: March 2019\n",
    "        Auto Insurance: Yes\n",
    "        Auto Insurance Deductible: $500 per incident\n",
    "        Auto Insurance Claims history: auto accident in Jan 2020; auto accident in Apr 2022 \n",
    "        Safe Driver Rating: 22 of 100\n",
    "        Home Insurance: No\n",
    "        Flood Insurance: No\n",
    "        Home Address: 100 Main Street, Seattle, WA\n",
    "        Flood Risk Factor: 8 of 10\n",
    "        Bundling Discount: No\n",
    "        Safe Driver Discount: No\n",
    "            \n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "    The model is built using Azure OpenAI ChatGPT-turbo base model, relevant information (insurance knowledge and user account information) is provided in the system prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "    The chatbot is working as expected, it can provide personalized answers based on knowledge base and user account information. A few manual evaluation examples on two user accounts are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note**: This notebook is built using the March 2023 version of ChatGPT (gpt-35-turbo). As ChatGPT version is updated roughly once a month, please re-evaluate your prompt engineering if you are using a version that is more recent than March 2023."

      "3. Safe Driver Discount: Maintaining a high safe driver score can make you eligible for a discount. Your safe driver rating is 22 of 100, which is below the threshold for a discount.

      "What are some ways for me to lower my insurance premium?\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "There are several ways to lower your insurance premium. Let's go through them one by one:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Bundling Discount: If you have more than one insurance plan with Contoso, you may be eligible for a bundling discount. Since you have home insurance with us, I recommend bundling your auto insurance as well to receive this discount.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Increase Deductible: The higher your deductible, the lower your premium will be. Your current deductible is $500 per incident, which is the average. If you're comfortable with a higher deductible, it could help lower your premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Safe Driver Discount: You have a safe driver rating of 90 out of 100, which is great! Maintaining a high safe driver score can make you eligible for a discount on your premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Driving Habit Tracking Device Discount: While you don't currently have a driving habit tracking device installed in your vehicle, doing so could make you eligible for a discount on your premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope these suggestions help! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Can you tell me more about bundling?\n",
      "---------------\n",
      "Certainly! Bundling is when you have more than one insurance plan with Contoso. For example, if you have both auto and home insurance with us, you may be eligible for a bundling discount. This means that you could receive a discount on both your auto and home insurance premiums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bundling can be a great way to save money on your insurance premiums while still maintaining the coverage you need. It also makes managing your policies easier since you only have to deal with one company for all of your insurance needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you already have home insurance with us, I recommend bundling your auto insurance as well to receive this discount. Let me know if you have any other questions!\n",
