# Introduction

This folder contains samples demonstrating how to use Embeddings models via Python SDK or REST API.

## Installation
Install all Python modules and packages listed in the requirements.txt file using the below command.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Microsoft Azure Endpoints
In order to use the Open AI library or REST API with Microsoft Azure endpoints, you need to set EMBEDDINGS_MODEL, OPENAI_API_BASE & OPENAI_API_VERSION in _config.json_ file. 

```js
{
    "EMBEDDINGS_MODEL":"<Embeddings Model Name>",
    "OPENAI_API_BASE":"https://<Your Azure Resource Name>.openai.azure.com",
    "OPENAI_API_VERSION":"<OpenAI API Version>"
}
``` 

### For getting started:
- Add "OPENAI_API_KEY" as variable name and \<Your API Key Value\> as variable value in the environment variables.
<br>
One can get the OPENAI_API_KEY value from the Azure Portal. Go to https://portal.azure.com, find your resource and then under "Resource Management" -> "Keys and Endpoints" look for one of the "Keys" values.
 <br>
 **STEPS** -       

      WINDOWS Users: 
         setx OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"

      MACOS/LINUX Users: 
         export OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"

- For  _Embeddings_ scenario, one can use "text-embedding-ada-002" as model name ("EMBEDDINGS_MODEL"in _config.json_ file).
- To find your "OPENAI_API_BASE" go to https://portal.azure.com, find your resource and then under "Resource Management" -> "Keys and Endpoints" look for the "Endpoint" value.
- Current OpenAI api version is "2022-12-01".
